# This is a full example of how to run the xkcd actor and http client on actor
# remote "stargate" host with an exposed with an HTTP server on Cosmonic.
# This example leverages wadm: https://github.com/wasmCloud/wadm/tree/main/wadm.
#
# Components are started on Cosmonic and startgate host(s).  See other examples for different scenarios.

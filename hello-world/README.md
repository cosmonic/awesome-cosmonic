# Hello world

This actor is the "Hello, World" of Cosmonic applications. It uses a single capability, HTTP server, and returns a string as a response. This project is actually a template, and if you'd like to try it for yourself, install the [cosmo cli](https://cosmonic.com/docs/getting-started/quickstart) and run:

```
cosmo new actor --git https://github.com/cosmonic/things-to-build --path hello-world/rust hello
cosmo launch -p hello
```

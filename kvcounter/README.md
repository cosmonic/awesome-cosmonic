# KVCounter

This actor uses two capabilities, HTTP server and KVCounter, incrementing a counter in a keyvalue store and returning the updated value as a response. This project is actually a template, and if you'd like to try it for yourself, install the [cosmo cli](https://cosmonic.com/docs/getting-started/quickstart) and run:

```
cosmo new actor --git https://github.com/cosmonic/things-to-build --path kvcounter/rust kvcounter
cosmo launch -p kvcounter
```
